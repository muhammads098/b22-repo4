I just craeted empty remote repository from GitHub.com account and cloned this repository by clicking on the plus icon on top right corner and new repository and give it a name and click create


And cloned this repository by clicking on set up in desktop and (optionally select the location) click on clone 

it cloned our remote repo to our local so we can start working locally.
